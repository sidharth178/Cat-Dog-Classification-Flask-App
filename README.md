### Introduction
In this project, we'll write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.  This is easy for humans, dogs, and cats but our computer will find it a bit more difficult.
### Data Description
The folder "train" contains two sub-folders "cats" & "dogs" which contain images of cats and dogs respectively.The folder "test1" contain unknown images which we have to classify.
### Data

### Objective
To build a deep learning classification model which classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat.
### How To Run
- Step-1: Download this repository.
- Step-2: Download the model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dVgI5xM9quI8ua8OpFwkpxLZmzcf3sfE/view?usp=sharing).Move the downloaded model into project folder.
- Step-3: In command prompt,go to this project directory.
- Step-4: Run this command.<code>python app.py</code>
